## <b>Artistic applications of AutoEncoders - Colorization</b> <br>

**[Sept20]** This is the result of the work done for the Artificial Intelligence with Deep Learning postgraduate course at the UPC (Ed. 2019-2020).

Exploring and understanding the filtering, denoising, colorization, etc. of images. Focus on colorization: Grayscale to Colored Image

**Milestones in the colorization subproject:**

Build a face images dataset based on Voxceleb2 - Exploring a vanilla AE - Using AE for face colorization

**Building the Dataset**

Development of a script to generate a subset of 110K face images by picking just a few frames from videos of Voxceleb2 dataset.

The script can be found in the following link:
