## <b>Artistic applications of AutoEncoders - Colorization</b> <br>

**[Sept20]** This is the result of the work done for the Artificial Intelligence with Deep Learning postgraduate course at the UPC (Ed. 2019-2020).

The goal of the project is to explore and understand the filtering, denoising, colorization, etc. of images but focus on colorization: 

**Grayscale to Colored Images**

**Milestones in the colorization subproject:**

Build a face images dataset based on Voxceleb2 - Exploring a vanilla AE - Using AE for face colorization

**Building the Dataset**

Development of a script to generate a subset of 110K face images by picking just a few frames from videos of Voxceleb2 dataset.

The script can be found in the following link:
[[Get Images Script]](https://github.com/abel-bernabeu/autoencoder/blob/master/colorization/Get_Images.ipynb) <br>

The generated dataset can be downloaded from the following link:

**Exploring a Vanilla AE**

Task developed for a better understanding of AutoEncoders, architectures, outputs etc...

The jupyter notebook used for this task can be found here:
